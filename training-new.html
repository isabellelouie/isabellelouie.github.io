        <section>
            <div class="section-head">
                <h2 class="h2-sm">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="heading first">Context</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as part of a senior level interaction design course at Simon Fraser
                    University. The objective was to partner with a local business to analyze the interactions within
                    their products, services, or operations, and to design a technology solution to improve some area of
                    process.
                </p>

                <h2 class="heading">Client</h2>
                <p><a href="https://oneiotagolf.com/" target="_blank">One Iota Golf Performance</a> is a golf analytics
                    company that provides avid golfers with data-driven insights to analyze and improve their game.
                    Through their desktop and mobile app, athletes can input data about each round, reflect on their
                    mental and physical performance, and uncover their strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>

                <h2 class="heading">Design Process</h2>
                <p>Our team approached the project using the five-step design thinking process:
                    <strong>Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>




            <div class="section-head">
                <h2 class="h2-sm">STARTING POINT</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="heading first">The Challenge</h2>
                <h3 class="subheading">Managing multiple ordering channels creates extra work and stress for a small
                    business owner.</h3>

                <p>In our initial meeting, our client explained that orders came from various channels,
                    including their website, Instagram messages, text messages, and recurring wholesale
                    orders.</p>

                <p>These channels required the owner to manually enter data into a spreadsheet, send order
                    information to their bakers and delivery drivers, and send order confirmation messages
                    to customers.</p>



                <h2 class="heading">The Opportunity</h2>
                <h3 class="subheading">How might we create a robust online experience to streamline orders through a
                    single platform?</h3>

                <p>With the multi-channel strategy hindering the company's scalability due to its reliance on manual
                    processes, our client expressed an interest in streamlining orders through the website.</p>

                <p>However, our client had been receiving complaints that customers were facing multiple
                    issues with the site, interferring with their ability to place orders.</p>

                <p>To better understand customers' pain points, our team decided to evaluate the design and structure of
                    the website's online ordering process to identify sources of friction and areas for improvement.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">The Plan</h2>
                <h3 class="subheading">Our team used three methods to assess the website: heuristic evaluations, an
                    online customer
                    feedback survey, and think-aloud usability studies.</h3>

                <p>This provided insight from three perspectives: current Bonus Bakery customers, prospective customers
                    who had never interacted with the company before, and our team of designers.</p>

                <p>This approach allowed our team to pinpoint critical usability issues, common pain points, and deeply
                    understand customers' ordering behaviors and preferences. Based on our research, our team then
                    developed a list of recommendations and created a high-fidelity prototype of a new design that would
                    better address customers’ needs.

                <p>Guided by <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielsen’s
                        principles</a>, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the
                    Bonus Bakery website, focusing on the process of ordering a single product for delivery
                    and in-store pickup. My complete heuristic evaluation report can be found <a

                <p>To supplement our findings from the heuristic evaluation, our team conducted an
                    online customer survey to gather qualitative feedback on the ordering process from Bonus
                    Bakery’s existing customers. 49 respondents were recruited through Bonus Bakery's Instagram and
                    Facebook pages.

            <h3 class="subheading">Conducting usability studies to understand customer behaviour</h3>

            <p>To gain a deeper understanding of customers’ interactions with the website, our team conducted four
                think-aloud usability studies on the existing website. I conducted tests with two
                participants: one current and one prospective customer.</p>

            <p>Participants were given three tasks and asked to describe their
                thoughts out loud as they completed them. Each task required participants to identify a product that
                fulfilled the needs of a given scenario and to go through the ordering process until they reached
                the checkout page.</p>

            <p>Our team then conducted affinity diagramming to organize the qualitative data
                collected, with four common issues emerging.</p>

                    <p>
                        This project provided an excellent opportunity to delve into various UX research methods, with a
                        particular emphasis on developing my skills in designing and conducting usability studies. </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the online survey allowed our team to collect a large number of responses in a short
                        amount of time, I appreciated how the usability studies offered richer and more nuanced
                        insights. By engaging a variety of stakeholders and using a think-aloud approach, I also gained
                        a deeper insight into users' priorities, feelings, and thought processes. This reaffirmed my
                        understanding of customers' needs and pain points, and ensured that we were tackling the 'right'
                        design issues before 'making the design right'.
                    </p>

                    <p>This was the first time I had taken the lead on designing and conducting usability studies, and I
                        thoroughly enjoyed the process. From recruiting participants and scheduling sessions to gaining
                        confidence in leading sessions with complete strangers, this project was a tremendous learning
                        opportunity and sparked a newfound passion for UX research.
