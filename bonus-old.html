                <p><a href="https://bonusbakery.com/" target="_blank">Bonus Bakery</a> is a plant-based bakery in
                    Vancouver, BC. My team and I evaluated their website and created an interactive prototype with
                    recommendations to optimize their online ordering process as part of a senior level design
                    evaluation course at Simon Fraser University. </p>

                <h2 class="h2-sm">ROLE</h2>
                <p>As a UX Researcher, I conducted heuristic evaluations, usability testing, and affinity diagramming to
                    identify customers' needs and pain points, which were then addressed in the website redesign.</p>

                <!-- <p>This project was completed as part of a senior level design evaluation course at Simon Fraser
                    University.</p> -->

                <h2 class="h2-sm">OUTCOME</h2>
                <p class="no-pad">Since the completion of this project, Bonus Bakery has implemented several of our
                    recommendations, including a simplified flavour selection process and a more straightforward
                    checkout page.</p>

                <h3>Managing multiple ordering channels creates extra work and stress for a small business
                    owner.</h3>

                <p>In our initial meeting, our client explained that orders came from various channels,
                    including their website, Instagram messages, text messages, and recurring wholesale
                    orders.</p>

                <p>These channels required the owner to manually enter data into a spreadsheet, send order
                    information to their bakers and delivery drivers, and send order confirmation messages
                    to customers.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How might we create a robust online experience to streamline orders through a single platform?</h3>

                <p>With the multi-channel strategy hindering the company's scalability due to its reliance on manual
                    processes, our client expressed an interest in streamlining orders through the website.</p>

                <p>However, our client had been receiving complaints that customers were facing multiple
                    issues with the site, interferring with their ability to place orders.</p>

                <!-- Common complaints included
                    being able to place orders after the daily deadline and subsequently having their order cancelled
                    and not receiving a payment confirmation. -->

                <p>To better understand customers' pain points, our team decided to evaluate the design and structure of
                    the website's online ordering process to identify sources of friction and areas for improvement.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Our team used three methods to assess the website: heuristic evaluations, an online customer
                    feedback survey, and think-aloud usability studies.</h3>

                <p>This provided insight from three perspectives: current Bonus Bakery customers, prospective customers
                    who had never interacted with the company before, and our team of designers.</p>

                <!-- <p>While the customer feedback survey allowed our team to collect a large number of
                    responses in a short amount of time, the usability studies offered deeper, more nuanced insights
                    from a smaller participant group.</p> -->

                <p>This approach allowed our team to pinpoint critical usability issues, common pain points, and deeply
                    understand customers' ordering behaviors and preferences. Based on our research, our team then
                    developed a list of recommendations and created a high-fidelity prototype of a new design that would
                    better address customers’ needs.

                        principles</a>, <mark>I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the
                        Bonus Bakery website</mark>, focusing on the process of ordering a single product for delivery
                    and in-store pickup. My complete heuristic evaluation report can be found <a

                <!-- <p> For each issue identified, I noted which
                    heuristic was violated, the severity of the issue, and potential solutions. Issues with a severity
                    rating of 3 or 4 were more critical as they hindered the user’s ability to complete tasks and were
                    therefore a higher priority. These ratings later guided our redesign process as they allowed our
                    team to address critical issues first, given the time constraints of our project.</p> -->

                <p>Using this prototype, our team conducted eight think-aloud usability studies
                    with current and prospective customers, with a process similar to the first round of studies
                    conducted on the existing website. <mark>I led four sessions: two with current customers and two
                        with prospective customers.</mark></p>

                <p class="add-pad">Participants were given three tasks and asked to describe their
                    thoughts out loud as they completed them. Each task required participants to identify a product that
                    fulfilled the needs of a given scenario and to go through the ordering process until they reached
                    the checkout page.</p>

                <h3>Usability testing is key to understanding the customer journey (and it might be my new favourite
                    skill).
                </h3>

                <p>
                    This project provided an excellent opportunity to delve into various UX research methods, with a
                    particular emphasis on developing my skills in designing and conducting usability studies. </p>
                <p>
                    Although the online survey allowed our team to collect a large number of responses in a short amount
                    of time, I appreciated how the usability studies offered richer and more nuanced insights. By
                    engaging a variety of stakeholders and using a think-aloud approach, I also gained a deeper
                    insight into users' priorities, feelings, and thought processes. This reaffirmed my
                    understanding of customers' needs and pain points, and ensured that we were tackling the 'right'
                    design issues before 'making the design right'.
                </p>

                <p>This was the first time I had taken the lead on designing and conducting usability studies, and I
                    thoroughly enjoyed the process. From recruiting participants and scheduling sessions to gaining
                    confidence in leading sessions with complete strangers, this project was a tremendous learning
                    opportunity and
                    sparked a newfound passion for UX research. </p>
