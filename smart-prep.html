                <p>As a UX Researcher, I conducted user interviews, online surveys, journey mapping, and co-hosted a
                    participatory workshop to understand the needs of amateur and professional golfers and design a
                    feature to help users address the weaknesses in their mental and physical golf game.

                    to identify sources of friction and areas for improvement.

                <p class="sub-p">First, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the online ordering process using <a
                        href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Jakob
                        Nielsen’s 10 interaction design principles</a>. For each issue identified, I noted which
                    heuristic was violated, the severity of the issue, and potential solutions. Issues with a severity
                    rating of 3 or 4 were more critical as they hindered the user’s ability to complete tasks and were
                    therefore a higher priority. These ratings later guided our redesign process as they allowed our
                    team to address critical issues first, given the time constraints of our project.</p>

                <p class="sub-p">The current delivery date selection menu does not take the bakery’s order deadlines
                    into account, so users can select a pickup / delivery option even after the deadline has passed.
                    There is also no mention of the order deadlines on the product pages, so the user must remember this
                    information from the initial pop-up on the home page.

                <p class="sub-p">To gain further insight into the issues identified in the heuristic evaluation, I

                <p class="sub-p">Participants were given three tasks and were asked to describe their

                    fulfilled the needs of a given scenario and to go through the ordering process until they reached
                    the checkout page.

                <p>A critical concern that participants expressed was that the deadline and

                    heuristic evaluation. Although this information was presented in an initial pop-up on the homepage,
                    many participants had difficulty recalling this information when it came to selecting their desired
                    delivery date.

                    This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore a variety of UX research methodologies and
                    develop my skills in designing and conducting usability studies. Analyzing, synthesizing, and
                    integrating research findings into data-driven design solutions was another key aspect of my
                    learning
                    experience.

                <p class="sub-p">
                    One significant takeaway was the critical role of participant selection in ensuring the reliability
                    of insights. Implementing a rigorous participant screening process and balancing participant
                    demographics across user groups enhanced the credibility of our research outcomes.
                </p>

                <p class="sub-p">
                    Our final deliverables were well-received by the client, and several of our recommendations were
                    swiftly integrated post-project completion, validating the impact of our research on the design
                    process.
