                <h2 class="heading first">Context</h2>
                <p>The Journey Here is a brand-new podcast produced at SFU Surrey and hosted by SFU Surreyʼs Executive
                    Director, Steve Dooley. During my time as a Communications Specialist
                    with the SFU Surrey Campus Administration team, I oversaw the pre-production, production,
                    post-production, and launch of The Journey Here. As this was quite an extensive project, my
                    responsibilities varied throughout each stage, with my main roles being the producer, audio
                    engineer, and graphic designer.

                <p class="add-pad">During the initial planning stage, we discussed the purpose, intended audience, and
                    vision for the podcast. We decided to expand our target audience to not only encompass our campus,
                    but the community builders of Surrey as well, as SFUʼs Surrey campus has a unique identity at the
                    intersection of university and community. Our vision for the podcast was to showcase the people in
                    our community who have positively impacted the places we live, the university, and our society. With
                    this established, we came up with a first draft of the podcast description.

                <p class="add-pad">Based on this description, I brainstormed a list of podcast names before narrowing it
                    down to three options: The Journey Here, Driving Us Forward, and The Path to Passion. We then sought
                    feedback on these options in a survey, and the name that elicited the most positive feedback was The
                    Journey Here. Using this name, I updated the podcast description and refined the language to better
                    reflect our vision.

                <p>Once we had established the name, description, and purpose of our podcast, it was
                    time to start talking to guests! In preparation for each interview, I researched our guests and
                    compiled a biography on them to provide Steve with some background information. Additionally, I
                    wrote interview questions and prompts for Steve to help guide their conversation. This work was
                    split between Rachel and me, and I completed the research for five of our guests.

            <p>Since we did not have a studio or the equipment to record interviews in person, we
                decided to host the interviews over Zoom. To test this setup, Steve recorded a trial episode with Nav
                Chima, Director, Community Programs & Partnerships at SFU Surrey. This episode was used to test the
                quality of Steveʼs microphone and also determined that wired headphones provided the best audio quality
                for guests. Additionally, we found that 30 minutes seemed to be the best length for our podcast format.

                For the first season of The Journey Here, we had a diverse line-up of nine guests scheduled, which
                included students, faculty, staff, and community leaders. During recording sessions, I briefed guests
                about the recording process, then recording the interviews locally onto my computer, with each
                speakerʼs audio saved in a separate file.

                discussed to create the show notes and episode description, and kept an ear out for any key phrases or
                themes that could be used for the episode title.

            <h2 class="heading">Designing the Cover Art</h2>
            <h3 class="subheading">An iterative process using Illustrator.</h3>

            <h4 class="pad-top">
                FIRST ITERATION
            </h4>

            <p class="add-pad">
                Using Adobe Illustrator, I created a rough, digital representation of the third concept sketch. In this
                first
                draft, I used a stock image of a skyline to roughly visualize the layout of the cover art.
            </p>


            <h4>
                SECOND ITERATION
            </h4>
            <p class="add-pad">
                Next, I used the photo of the Surrey Central skyline from our brainstorming as a reference to create a
                vector illustration outlining the silhouettes of the most prominent buildings in downtown Surrey. In
                this iteration, I noted that the sky seemed to be overcast and the grass looked too dark.
            </p>


            <h4>
                THIRD ITERATION
            </h4>
            <p class="add-pad">
                As such, I lightened the sky and the grass, and added rounded clouds to make the art appear more
                friendly and welcoming. Reflecting on this iteration, I realized three things: the skyline looked very
                cluttered, the building colours appeared dull and uninteresting, and there was nothing that would make
                viewers immediately make a visual connection with SFU Surrey or Surrey Central.</p>

            <h4>
                FINAL ITERATION
            </h4>
            <p class="add-pad">
                With these three considerations in mind, I replaced the center buildings with an illustration of SFU
                Surreyʼs new building on University Drive. While creating the building outline, I recalled that we had
                recently unveiled a new 24-foot SFU sign outside this building; this provided a subtle and seamless way
                for me to incorporate the word “SFU” into the design itself. Next, I added more detail to the Central
                City tower to make it more recognizable and to strengthen the image of downtown Surrey. Finally, since I
                wanted to bring focus to these two prominent buildings, I reduced the number of high-rise buildings and
                added minimal details such as windows and shadows.

            <p>
                The first season of the podcast was a great success, reaching over 600 listeners. This project was a new
                and exciting experience for me, as this was my first time tackling a project of
                such magnitude. With such an extensive project, I was presented with numerous opportunities to take on
                new roles, gain new skills, and build upon my existing experiences.
            </p>

            <p> In particular, this was a great opportunity to expand my skills in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Audition,
                and I can certainly say that I have become much confident with these programs. Additionally, juggling
                this project with my other ongoing projects provided a fantastic opportunity to improve my time
                management, organization, and communication skills.
            </p>

            <p> There were many times where I was faced with a task that I had never done before, such as creating a
                digital illustration for the podcast cover art, yet I was able to reflect on my previous experiences,
                learn from online resources, and draw from the expertise and feedback of my colleagues to support my
                work.
            </p>

            <p> Reflecting on the process of creating a podcast from scratch and seeing it through from start to finish,
                I feel a great sense of gratification and pride in the work that I have put into this project. Overall,
                this has been an extremely valuable learning experience, and I am eager to carry forward the skills I
                have gained to my future endeavours.
