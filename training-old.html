                    company that provides avid golfers with data-driven insights to analyze and improve their game.
                    Through their desktop and mobile app, athletes can input data about each round, reflect on their
                    mental and physical performance, and uncover their strengths and weaknesses.

                    <!-- of mental and physical performance, good habit making, and continual progression, -->
                    to better support users’ training and development.

                    including their website, Instagram messages, text messages, and recurring wholesale
                    orders.</p>

                <h3>Telling users their weaknesses isn't helpful if they don't know what to do to improve.</h3>

                <p> One Iota's current system analyzes data from each inputted round of golf and provides
                    a summary of users' technical strengths and weaknesses. However, there
                    are no resources provided within the app to help users work on their weaknesses, meaning users need
                    to leave the app and find ways to improve on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app also prompts users to complete a mental performance reflection survey after each round and
                    provides a quantitative score out of 100 based on the user's responses. Although this
                    score is calculated from a variety of factors such as mental focus and attitude, this number
                    does not produce any specific, meaningful data or actionable insights.
                </p>

                <!-- <p>Without a coach, it can be unorganized and challenging to find drills online. As a result, many
                    golfers resort to practicing the same drills over and over, which may not be the most effective use
                    of their time.</p> -->

                <p>With the multi-channel strategy hindering the company's scalability due to its reliance on manual

                    feedback survey, and think-aloud usability studies.</h3>

                <p>This provided insight from three perspectives: current Bonus Bakery customers, prospective customers
                    who had never interacted with the company before, and our team of designers.</p>

                <!-- <p>While the customer feedback survey allowed our team to collect a large number of
                    responses in a short amount of time, the usability studies offered deeper, more nuanced insights
                    from a smaller participant group.</p> -->

                <p>This approach allowed our team to pinpoint critical usability issues, common pain points, and deeply
                    understand customers' ordering behaviors and preferences. Based on our research, our team then
                    developed a list of recommendations and created a high-fidelity prototype of a new design that would
                    better address customers’ needs.

                        interaction design principles</a>, <mark>I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the

                    and in-store
                    pickup. My complete heuristic evaluation report can be found <a

                <!-- <p> For each issue identified, I noted which

                    rating of 3 or 4 were more critical as they hindered the user’s ability to complete tasks and were
                    therefore a higher priority. These ratings later guided our redesign process as they allowed our
                    team to address critical issues first, given the time constraints of our project.</p> -->

                <h3>Usability testing is key to understanding the customer journey</h3>

                <p>
                    This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore a variety of UX research methods and
                    develop my skills in designing and conducting usability studies. Although the online survey allowed
                    our team to collect a large number of responses in a short amount of time, I appreciated how the
                    usability studies offered much richer and more nuanced insights.</p>

                <p>
                    By engaging a variety of stakeholders and using a think-aloud approach, I gained a deeper
                    understanding of users' priorities, feelings, and thought processes. This reaffirmed my
                    comprehension of customers' needs and pain points, and ensured that we were tackling the 'right'
                    design issues before 'making the design right'.
                </p>

                <p>Another significant takeaway was the importance of prioritizing research insights. With time being
                    one of our biggest constraints, it was crucial to create a product backlog and prioritize features
                    that addressed more critical usability concerns first.</p>

                <!-- <p>
                    Analyzing, synthesizing, and integrating our research findings into a data-driven design solution
                    was another key aspect of my learning experience.
                </p> -->

                <!-- <p>
                    Another significant takeaway was the importance of recruiting a variety of stakeholders for our
                    research. It was enlightening to hear from and observe the experiences of the business owner,
                    current customers, prospective customers, and our design team. Each stakeholder group provided a
                    unique perspective that helped create a comprehensive picture of their needs and pain points, and
                    opportunities for our team to intervene.
                </p> -->

                <p>
                    In conclusion, our final deliverables were well-received by the client, and several of our
                    recommendations were swiftly integrated post-project completion. This project was also featured in
