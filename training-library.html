                <p>This project was completed as part of a senior level interaction design course at Simon Fraser
                    University. The objective was to partner with a local business to analyze the interactions within
                    their products, services, or operations, and to design a technology solution to improve some area of
                    process.

                <hr>
            </div>

            <h2 class="heading first">The Client</h2>
            <h3 class="subheading">One Iota Performance Inc, a golf analytics company in Vancouver, BC.</h3>
            <p>Launched in 2023, <a href="https://oneiotagolf.com/" target="_blank">One Iota Performance</a> is a
                golf analytics platform that provides avid golfers with data-driven insights to analyze and improve
                their game. Through the desktop and mobile apps, athletes can input data about each round, reflect on
                their mental and physical performance, and uncover their strengths and weaknesses.
            </p>

            <p> With so many golf analytics apps on the market, One Iota aims to differentiate itself by
                placing equal emphasis on mental and physical performance, encouraging good habit making, and equipping
                golfers with the tools to make continual progress, one iota at a time.
            </p>


            <h2 class="heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <h3 class="subheading">Investigating the onboarding process' high drop-off rate.</h3>

            <p> In our initial meeting, our client noted that many new users were dropping off during the onboarding
                process, so our team decided to explore this issue further. Was the onboarding process too complicated?
                Is the key value not communicated effectively? Or are there any other factors at play?</p>


            <h2 class="heading">The Plan</h2>
            <h3 class="subheading">A double diamond approach: designing the right thing before designing things right.
            </h3>

            <p> Our team decided to begin with exploratory user research to gain an ethnographic understanding of the
                habits, needs, and pain points of professional and amateur golfers.
            </p>

            <p> Based on our findings, our team then conducted several rounds of concept exploration and refinement,
                incorporating feedback and critique from key stakeholders, to ensure the final product met both
                business requirements and user needs.

                <p> To start off our research, our team conducted ride-along interviews with one amateur and two
                    competitive golfers to observe their experiences with One Iotaâ€™s onboarding process and
                    user interface first-hand.</p>

                <p class="add-pad"> I also designed an online survey to gain broader insight into golfersâ€™ existing
                    perceptions and experiences with performance tracking apps in general, reaching 58
                    participants.

                    <p> Although the onboarding process was tedious, with users having to go through a series of
                        long tutorial videos, this seemed to be more of an information design problem and not the root
                        cause of One Iota's low user conversion and retention.

                    <p>Initially, our team did not have enough golf knowledge to understand whether One Iotaâ€™s existing
                        features provided value to users. However, in-depth conversations and observational ride-alongs
                        with golfers unveiled a deeper understanding of golf culture, including an unspoken rule of not
                        using cell phones on the course, and a common drive for improvement and excellence.</p>

            <!-- <p>
                    Moving on to 1 of 3 features we have Concept #1: Custom Dashboard. This concept addresses the pain
                    point of data overload. By allowing users to customize their dashboard, we enable them to prioritize
                    the data that's most relevant to their goals, streamlining their experience. However, feedback
                    suggests that while useful, it does not contribute to new learning. It's a feature that enhances
                    existing habits but does not necessarily create new value.

                    Next, we introduce Concept #2: Lesson Library. This addresses the issue of golfers practicing
                    without guidance, often repeating the same drills. By suggesting lessons based on logged statistics,
                    we can offer tailored content. This 'prescribed' learning can significantly improve their
                    effectiveness. Feedback indicates a desire for a feature that tracks progress over time, giving
                    users a sense of achievement and clear development pathways.

                    Lastly, brings us to Concept #3: Mindfulness Training. Mental wellness is often overlooked in sports
                    apps. Our mindfulness training tab provides users with suggested lessons based on their reflective
                    surveys. Itâ€™s a step towards holistic wellness. Yet, there's room for improvement, like prescribing
                    specific modules based on data analysis and considering the stigma around 'mindfulness' as a term.



                    navigating the large amount of statistics generated, addressing shortcomings in users'
                    mental performance, and creating an action plan based on their game analysis.

                    Through the insights found from our workshop, surveys, interviews and external research, we ideated
                    on three possible directions that the project could go in: education through beer coasters, beer
                    passports, and a beer-matching quiz. With each idea, we created a storyboard to show how our
                    personas would go through each experience.</p> -->

            <p>The workshop took place on November 18th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm, and was hosted on Zoom and Miro.</p> -->

            <h4 class="pad-top">Key Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Is One Iota effectively communicating their core values to their users?</li>
                <li>Are One Iota usersâ€™ needs being met and are the current/proposed features in line with their values?
                </li>
                <li>What would it take to make users of competing apps switch to One Iota?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="pad-top">Participants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Current One Iota users (one amateur and one professional golfer)</li>
                <li>1 One Iota developer</li>
                <li>1 Mental training coach for SFU Golf</li>
                <li>1 User of a competing golf app</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="pad-top">Activities</h4>
            <ol class="add-pad">
                <li>An <strong class="bold">Idea Sprint</strong> was used to quickly determine the top five factors
                    influencing user decisions to choose or switch to a different golf performance tracking app. This
                    provided an open-ended way to discover what qualities were most important to users.
                </li><br>
                <li>The <strong class="bold">Brand Identity Moodboard</strong> activity provided a comparison between
                    how One Iota wants to be perceived and how they are currently perceived by current and
                    prospective users.
                </li><br>
                <li>The final <strong class="bold">Feature Ranking</strong> activity helped our team gauge which
                    existing and proposed features were most valuable to each of our user groups.</li>

                <p> Drawing on insights from our stakeholder workshop, our team evolved our concept into a unified
                    training library, offering mental and technical training within a single, comprehensive platform.
                </p>

                <p class="add-pad">I developed a concept poster and storyboard for the Training Library, emphasizing its

                    <p>
                        One of the key challenges in this project was my unfamiliarity with the sport of golf, as I
                        did not have any background knowledge on the habits and needs of golfers and the nuances of the
                        sport.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This created a fantastic opportunity to leverage my existing research experience in designing
                        surveys and conducting interviews, while gaining new skills in running stakeholder workshops and
                        crafting in-depth user journey maps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project was such a fun experience, and the opportunity to help a local start-up company
                        further develop their product and strengthen their market position was extremely rewarding,
                        further affirming my interest in pursuing a career in user experience research!
